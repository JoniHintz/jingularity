Quickstart
The Main Methode

...
public static void main(String[] args){
                      // Breite, Hoehe, Titel, FPS  
     Frame f = new Frame(800, 600, "Game", 60);
     f.pushState(new Menue(f));
     f.run();
}

States
States are the core component of Jingularity
The behaviour of the game can be defined in the states.
Different states mean different behaviour.

States and Frame
It is recomended to give the frame to the states and to store it as a field. 
With the frame it is possible to add action listeners and states can be changed.


StateMethods

public void enter()
Always ececuted when the state becomes the active state.
This is the place to add action listeners.

public void enter(State preState)
like enter but the previous state get passed.
It is called when a state is poped (see StatePop() in Frame),
to make it possible to acess information from the otherwise lost state.
If this is never necessary for a state enter state can simply call eneter()


public void update(double dt)
called in the main loop while the state is active.
dt is the time since the last update.

public void draw(Graphics g)
Used to draw graphics on screen. G is a double buffered target that frame draws to the screen. 
See java.awt.Graphics for more informations.

Blit 
There are two simple ways to blit the screen.
The backgroud can be redrawn in every draw method or the blit flag in the framework can be set 
by uising setBlit(true)

public void exit()
Called when a new state is entered.
Remove the action listeners here.

Das Frame
The Frame class combines loop controll and graphics.

Frame methods

public void statePush(State state)
Push the state to the peak of the state stack, state is now the active state.

public void statePop()
Pop the state from the state stack. And make the next state the active state.
If the state stack is empty the application will be terminated.

public void replaceState(State state)
a combination between pop and push.

other methods
public int getWidth()
public int getHeight()
public void setTitle(String title)
